# SimpleFormUsingViewModel-LiveData-DataBinding

ViewModel: It manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.

LiveData: It notifies views of any database changes. Use LiveData to build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.

Data Binding: It helps in declaratively binding UI elements to in our layout to data sources of our app.
